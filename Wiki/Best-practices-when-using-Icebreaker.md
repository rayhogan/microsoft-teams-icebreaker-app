## 1. Create a new dedicated team for Icebreaker 

While it might be tempting to install Icebreaker in an existing team, we recommend creating a separate team. This approach has several benefits: It allows people to opt-in to pairings. It keeps day-to-day work separate from Icebreaker goings-on. Lastly, it allows members to easily leave if they find it a distraction. 

## 2. Announce Icebreaker to your team 

You’d want to get your team amped up about the new idea and pair ups. Here is a sample text you can use to announce Icebreaker within your team or via email to your teammates: 

> “Hey Team! 
>  
> We’re trying out a new Teams Bot called Icebreaker that will randomly pair team members up every Monday for a meet up.  
>
> What do you need to do to get paired up? Just join the <You Team Name here> team and hang tight. The bot will take it from there. You (and the randomly chosen teammate) get a personal message from the bot every Monday letting you know who you are paired up with. You’re free to grab lunch, coffee or whatever that floats your boat.  
>
> Opting out is easy too, just click the opt-out button when the bot sends you the message. Opt back in any time by chatting with the bot. 
>
> We’re excited to hear your feedback on the pair ups. Do leave a note in our channel!” 

## 3. Invite others to join the team 

Make sure to invite others regularly to have fresh faces and keep the excitement going. Additionally, it is a perfect opportunity to drive new employee engagement, mentorship circles or special hobby groups. 

## 4. Create multiple teams for Icebreaker 

If Icebreaker is working well for your team, consider creating another team for additional meet ups. Some good options are to create teams based on location, departments, shared interests, skills or culture. 

## 5. Encourage people to post selfies and have discussions 

Leverage the team channel to drive discussions and encourage people to share experiences. New members will find this as helpful context as they decide to engage with each other. 

## 6. Plant influencers 

Talk to a few key influencers in the team and have them post discussions and selfies so it encourages rest of the group to engage. Maintain active interest by posting your own thoughts and perspectives. 

## 7. Need a break from your busy social life? It's ok to take a breather.

We understand that life gets busy and meeting up with new people isn’t always possible. There are two options available to take a break (for example, when you’re traveling, on vacation or busy at work): 

1. Pause the pairings (the bot includes an easy option to pause pairings): Don’t forget to un-pause once you’re back or ready to engage again! 

2. Leave the team: This is also an option. That is why it is important to set up a separate team for meet ups so that leaving the team is also an option for members without losing work items.
